## Usage

Run the script using go

```
$ go run script.go -d<value> -o<value> -s<value> -t <value>
or
$ go run script.go -directory<value> -output<value> -size<value> -type <value>
```

Or to use the single file details utility

```
$ go run script.go -sb<value>
or
$ go run script.go --sub-directory<value>
```

Or

```
$ go run script.go -fi<value>
or
$ go run script.go  --file-details<value>
```

For example

```
$ go run script.go -d C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\torrents\\input -o C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\torrents\\output  -s 200GB -t 1
```

Takes all torrents in directory input, sorts them by size and splits them into 200GB folders in directory output

```
$ go run script.go -sb C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\torrents\\input\\tor1.torrent
```

Gets the torrent called tor1 and prints it's Path/Name , size in bytes and hash as a single line comma separated values

```
$ go run script.go -fi C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\torrents\\input\\tor1.torrent
```

Gets the torrent called tor1 and prints each of it's files Path/Name and size in bytes as a single line comma separated values
